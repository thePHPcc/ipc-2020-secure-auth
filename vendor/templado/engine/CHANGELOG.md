# Changelog

All notable changes to Templado are documented in this file using the [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/) principles.

##[4.0.2] - 2019-11-21

### Fixed
* [#17](https://github.com/templado/engine/issues/17): CSRFPotectionRenderer fails to update existing token element when in xml namespace


##[4.0.1] - 2019-09-20

### Changed

* The `Iterator` returned by the `Selection` class is no longer based on `DOMNodeList` but on `ArrayIterator`. This is
  necessary to not have the list reset on changes to the DOM but to provide a stable Snapshots of the selection result.   


##[4.0.0] - 2019-09-13

### Changed
* The `ViewModelRenderer` now ensures that text content can no longer be used to create syntactically invalid markup.
  While this is technically a bug fix, some  may consider it a BC break as it also removes the "non-feature" of
  having a model returning xml/html markup. If you need html fragments to be inserted please use a snippet instead.

* `SnapshotDOMNodelist` no longer implements \Iterator and \Countable as those became superflous

### Fixed
* ViewModelRenderer: Might skip a node when processing arrays due to invalid use of an foreach on iteration

##[3.0.1] - 2019-05-26

### Changed 
* The `SnippetFileLoader` now returns `TempladoSnippts` for templado type snippets rather than `SimpleSnippets`, 
which never workd reliably due to DOMDocumentFragment issues.

### Fixed
* Fix iterable detection in ViewModelRenderer
* Fix potential index underflow in SnapshotDomNodelist


##[3.0.0] - 2019-05-16

### Changed
